## Background:
Beach litter monitoring still relies on manual methods that are resource and time-intensive. A systematic and innovative way is needed to monitor beach litter more effectively.

## Proposed Solution:
This project proposes an AI Computer Vision technology to perform object segmentation on beaches, specifically for natural and man-made litter. The algorithms used for object segmentation in this project are the Resnet50-Unet and YOLOv8 segmentation models.

## Dataset:
This project uses a dataset from the paper "Pixel-level image classification for detecting beach litter using a deep learning approach" by Hidaka, Mitsuko. et al., 2022. This dataset consists of 3500 beach litter images and 3500 corresponding pixel-labeled images. Based on these images, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology created 3500 images consisting of eight semantic mask classes for detecting beach litter, available at the following link: [Beach Litter Dataset](https://www.seanoe.org/data/00743/85472/).
